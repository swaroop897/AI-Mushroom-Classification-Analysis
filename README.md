🧠 Uncovering the Hidden Treasures of the Mushroom Kingdom

A Classification Analysis Using Deep Learning

📌 Overview
This project focuses on classifying mushroom species using deep learning techniques. By leveraging transfer learning, the model accurately categorizes mushrooms into three genera:

Boletus

Lactarius

Russula

The goal is to build a robust visual classification system that helps recognize mushrooms found in various regions worldwide.
